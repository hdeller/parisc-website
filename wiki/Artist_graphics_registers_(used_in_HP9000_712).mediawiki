title: Artist graphics registers (used in HP9000/712)
---

Artist is the onboard graphics chip used in the HP9000/712. According to HP, it's mostly compatible to CRX. On the 712, it spans the I/O memory range 0xf4000000-0xf5ffffff. Unfortunately no documentation seems to be available, but this is what i figured out by looking at the memory write from the Bootrom/STI code:

|Color map used by STI code - Strange offset address, maybe software configurable? One entry spans 32 bit, where Bit 23-16=R, Bit16-8=G, Bit7-0=B
