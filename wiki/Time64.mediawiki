title: Time64
---

Thought during debian's time64 transition:

* gstreamer
Use 1.22. It seems the actual versions have to match.  I also edited the version info gstreamer1.0 (meson.build and gstreamer.doap) so version in pkgconfig file is 1.24.0.
Besides the gst packages, we also need an old version of webkit2gtk.  The latest version depends on features added in gstreamer 1.24.

I'm having to work around issues caused by lack of clang and rust compilers.  A few packages now need 64-bit.

The hard part has been setting up and maintaining chroot.  I need wxwidgets3.2 and webkit2gtk builds to complete transition for giant ffmpeg dependency loop.  Then, I should be able to an apt upgrade for chroot.
These are the packages that I have or will do manual builds in chroot:
gnuplot hdf5 libnsl vtk9 dbus-c++  gst-plugins-bad1.0 ibus librsvg webkit2gtk
gst-plugins-base1.0 imagemagick libtirpc weston efl gst-plugins-good1.0 leptonlib
pmix wxwidgets3.2 ffmpeg gstreamer1.0 libcroco poppler

The gst* and  webkit2gtk sources are from trixie.  They are last versions that built on hppa.  I just did +b1 uploads for them.

librsvg is last version that built on hppa.  Same for libcroco. libcroco packages have been deleted from debian archive.  However librsvg lib depends on libcroco lib.

I can details of versions for other packages.  Some needed +b1 rebuilds of last versions that built.  Others, just needed to be built in chroot to fix dependencies.

Current version of gnuplot needs wxwidgets3.2.  Maybe it will build after we get build of it.
Testsuite just failed...  I have been ignoring testsuite issues.
