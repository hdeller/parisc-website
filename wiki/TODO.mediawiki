= PA-RISC Linux TODO =

== Updates for next newsletter ==
* fixed 64bit SMP kernel & sticon on machines with more than 4GB RAM
* Dave found O_SYNC bug in glibc
* Migration parisc-linux.org
* debian-ports.org access

== Status & TODO 2013-10-09 (TODO-List by Helge Deller) ==
* send patches to remove UP from debian kernels.
* gdb crashes Kernel - http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.parisc/5406
* glib2.0 atomic bug: Dave: I see the problem building various packages -- apt is is one. It occurs when multiple dot processes are started by graph when package documentation is being generated.  The number of dot processes spawned depends on the number of processors on the build system.  However, the faults occur even on a UP system. I debugged one of these segvs enough to see that the problem occurred in a glib2.0 library.  It's using the GCC "sync" interface. 
* debian parisc perl bug (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=721537) shows that mmap on parisc linux is horribly inefficient.  We allocate huge maps for small files. This should be improved. Mailthread: " parisc mmap: private file maps" ,http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-parisc/msg05083.html
* More signals? > Can we change _NSIG to 69 so there are 32 RT signals as on other arches? It looks like it needs to be a power of 2.  MIPS uses 128. 

* currently planned features for 3.13 / 3.14:
** better implementation to get stack pointer (in return_address(), in stack checker in irq.c, ...)
** pdc_chassis LEDs not updated (Attention blinks always) on rp5470 ? (works on B2000), Virtual Front Panel -> why does "Attention" blinks? Code in pdc_chassis.c, see PDC_CHASSIS in http://ftp.parisc-linux.org/docs/arch/pdc20-v1.1-Ch4-pdc.pdf
** physically broken memory in Dave's machine - utilize PDT (http://ftp.parisc-linux.org/docs/arch/pdc20-v1.1-Ch4-pdc.pdf (page #46)) - https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2541561/

* Kernel: Hard to solve outstanding issues
** megaraid on my rp5470 hangs at boot (maybe because SCSI chassis not connected)?
** Fix FireGL X1/X3 in C8000 - currently broken (no DRM and software accel is incredibly slow plus colors in 24bpp mode are wrong) - Info: manual "Radeon R5xx Acceleration" - http://www.x.org/docs/AMD/R5xx_Acceleration_v1.1.pdf  and generic: http://www.botchco.com/agd5f/?p=50 

* Kernel: still missing Linux kernel development (no patches available yet):
** implement .con_font_set (consw) in sticon.c (to be able to change fonts at runtime)
** Implement CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE ?
** fix wrong _init notation in kernel
** NO_IRQ -> should be converted to (0) instead of (-1) -> Helge (check assembly, check in drivers/parisc/*)
** implement alternative coding for UP/SMP. See arch/x86/include/asm/alternative.h
** check assembly in drivers/parisc/*
** use pdc_add_valid() in kern_addr_valid(),  protect against crashable acesses (like for superio-pc-drivers-detection in lp), add pdc_add_valid() to create a probe_kernel_read() implementation.
** arch/parisc/kernel/sys_parisc.c -> use SYSCALL_ALIAS() -> maybe
** on C8000, report 1 socket with 2 cores.
** implement HUGE pages (or even better transparent huge pages)
** Review gettimeofday and clock_gettime() implementation, possibly use a light-weight-syscall and rely on cr16 and cpu speed for more accurate timing? similiar to commit http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/commit/?id=18ad51dd342a7eb09dbcd059d0b451b616d4dafc 

* Kernel: Low priority patches needs further work 
** Fix exception table entries to be of type int (32bit), even on 64bit kernel -> saves space. - https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/3033801/
** disable FP-register save/restore at kernel entry? - Helge
** enable 16k/64k kernel page sizes (still cacheflushing-issues with SCSI driver, additional work in glibc needed to deal with >4k page size, e.g. ld-loader alignments of data/code segments)
** Superdome support - can someone test? Should work better now with latest kernels.
** task_struct/thread_info split -- task_struct should not be visible in entry.S, we need to move some items into thread_info -- this includes pt_regs and maybe some of the flags (ptrace, etc)
** Visualize FX support (will probably never happen!)

* Debian packaging work:
** Build real debian-installer CD. See: https://wiki.debian.org/Simple-CDD/Howto
** DONE: we need a kernel debian package (3.10 based or higher)
** ONGOING: debian-ports/parisc repository aka. syning debs to there
*** DONE: Helge to contact Aurelien (aurel32) on #debian-glibc on OFTC IRC
*** Instructions from Thorsten Glaser - see: http://lists.debian.org/debian-hppa/2013/04/msg00049.html
*** DONE: try to debootstrap from parisc-linux.org repository and add missing packages.
** DONE: split repository on parisc-linux.org into stable (wheezy) and unstable (sid)

* Debian packages / Userspace work
** IMPORTANT: fix OpenJDK - fixes required in zeroport (stack grows up!).
** 64-bit userspace, 64-bit binutils needs to be fixed to get multiple stub section support.
** gcc -> join 32- and 64bit compiler, make "-m64" work, get rid of hppa64-linux-gnu-gcc
   
* Debian infrastructure work:
** Ask Thibaut to add ftp mirror of http://ftp.parisc-linux.org/debian_ports on http://www.fr.parisc-linux.org/ 
** ONGOING: Set up a buildd server for debian-ports/unstable
*** https://buildd.debian.org/docs/buildd-setup.txt
** we still need appropriate machines and possibly try to gain access to the previous setup at HP.
** contact pannonmage@gmail.com (Nemeth Balint, Budapest) to set up buildd server - mail from 04.08.2013
** set up buildd server on ESIEE's A500 (Thibaut) - mail from 13.08.2013 
** DONE: Use reprepro to produce correct apt-able subdirectories for packages on http://ftp.parisc-linux.org/debian-ports/debian/

* Homepage migration:
** ONGOING: Migration of parisc-linux.org website to https://parisc.wiki.kernel.org
** Domain ownwer: Matt Taggart <matt@lackof.org>, Expiration Date:09-Aug-2014 23:07:58 UTC
** New domain owner: Thibaut VARENE <T-Bone@parisc-linux.org> <T-Bone@slashdirt.org>
** Server administrator of parisc-linux.org: Dann Frazier - dannf@dannf.org
** Technical contact at HP: brett.johnson@hp.com

* palo (PA-RISC Boot Loader):
** Modify (if possible), that palo can read (sequential) tftpbootable-vmlinuxes as well as the current boot-vmlinux images (simplifies build/handling)
** add xz-compression support, maybe move decompression to Linux kernel instead of palo?

== Review all the todo entries below! ==

* ns87415 dma doesn't work reliably on suckyio-systems

* investigate not putting in extable entries for put_kernel_asm; will probably reduce kernel size

* fix HIL problem: ksoftirqd/0 eats 56% cpu (kernel 2.4 & kernel 2.6) - see FAQ: http://www.parisc-linux.org/faq/index.html and http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.parisc/278/match=use+lower+nice+level+ksoftirqd+hil+enabled
