Sparse is a tool to do compile-time checks on C code. Sparse can create a parse tree of C code, similar to a GCC frontend. Using this parse tree, it is possible to create additional compile-time checks of source code, in addition to what regular C provides. 

For example, a system call can be passed a userspace pointer. In regular C, this will simply be a <tt>void *</tt>. However, the kernel cannot directly dereference this pointer. There is no syntax to denote this restriction in regular C, and if a kernel developer makes a mistake, s/he will only discover it at runtime, probably in the form of a kernel crash. Sparse allows a developer to encode this restriction by annotating the pointer as <tt>void __user *</tt>, where <tt>__user</tt> denotes a separate address space.

There are currently three address spaces recognized by the kernel:

* User address space, annotated with <tt>__user</tt>
* Kernel address space, no annotation
* I/O memory address space, annotated with <tt>__iomem</tt>

These are defined in <tt>include/linux/compiler.h</tt>

The sparse source code is kept in [http://www.bkbits.net/ BitKeeper] at bk://kernel.bkbits.net/torvalds/sparse, snapshots can be found at http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/bitkeeper/sparse/
