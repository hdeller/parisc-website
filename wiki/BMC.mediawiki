= Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)  =

The C8000 has a BMC (baseboard management controller) that is active when the system is powered.
When attached to the serial console, you can press ESC ( and you will be able to interact with the BMC:

 ESC (
 cli>help
 CLI Commands:
   C [<passwordstring>]  - Change Password
   CON                   - Display Console selection
   FPL                   - Read Forward Progress Log
   H                     - Help (this text)
   I <ipmi command data> - Send any IPMI message
      req fmt: rsSA netfnlun chk1 rqSWID rqSeq cmd [data] chk2
      resp fmt: rqSWID netfnlun chk3 rsSa rqSeqrsLun cmd ccode [data] chk4
   INFO                  - Display BMC FW Revision
   IPMI <ipmi command data> - Send any IPMI message
      req fmt: netfnlun cmd [data]
      resp fmt: ccode [data]
   P [0,1]               - Power Control
   Q                     - Quit/Logout
   RS  [s]               - Reset System [and switch to sys console]
   SD                    - Read SDR Repository
   SE                    - Read System Event Log
   TOC [s]               - Send an INIT/TOC [and switch to sys console]
 cli>

This most useful for being able to remotely reboot (RS command) and power on/off (P command) the system.
Pressing ESC ) "reconnects" one to the system's serial console.

The C8000 supports IPMI, and presumably a lot of these same things 
can be done over the built-in e1000 LAN interface once configured.

In [[File:Lpv00338 rx2600 zx6000.pdf]] you can find a chapter with a broader description of the BMC.


'''Please note that most older parisc machines don't have a BMC, but instead a GSP, see [[GuardianServiceProcessor]].'''
