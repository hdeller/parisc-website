title: Offline Diagnostic Environment (ODE)
---

Offline Diagnostic Environment (ODE) is a anvironment to test various hardware present in HP700/800 servers. It is usually distributed as ISO image, which contains a LIF image with ISL + ODE binary + other data. To boot it in qemu, it is sufficient to boot it:

 qemu-system-hppa -boot d -cdrom hp9000offlinediagnosticpa0512/HP9000\ Offline\ Diagnostic\ Environment\ PA0512\ \(Hewlett-Packard\ Development\ Company,\ L.P.\)\(2005\).iso

This will boot to ISL:

 HARD Booted.
 
 ISL Revision A.00.44  Mar 12, 2003 
 
    
    Cannot find an auto-execute file.  AUTOBOOT ABORTED.
 
 
 ISL>

Typing ode will start the diagnostic environment. It is possible to start a specific test by adding it to ode:

 ODE L2DIAG

will start the PCXL2 CPU tests. This will ask for a password, in qemu it's usually 'quality'

 ISL_CMD> l2diag

 L2DIAG is the PCXL2 ODE based diagnostic program.  It is intended
 to test the processor of the various PCXL2 based systems in the offline
 environment.  The program consists of 119 sections, 1/119,
 and are organized into the following groups: 
 
    1.  CPU data path tests, Sections 1/6 (6 sections)
    2.  ICACHE tests, Sections 7/10 (4 sections)
    3.  DCACHE tests, Sections 11/17 (7 sections)
    4.  2nd Level Cache tests, Sections 18/21 (4 sections)
    5.  TLB tests, Sections 22/27 (6 sections)
    6.  CPU instruction tests, Sections 28/76 (49 sections)
    7.  CPU extended tests, Sections 77/88  (12 sections)
    8.  Floating point tests, Sections  89/119 (31 sections)

A test or range of test can be selected by 'section X or section X/Y' where X is the starting test number, and Y the ending test number. If only X is specified, only test X is run.
