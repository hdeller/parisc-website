= The PA-RISC/Linux Project =

== What is it? ==

PA-RISC is the proprietary HP RISC processor architecture originally designed for HP-UX. Project to run Linux on these machines started in October 1998. Linux first booted on PA-RISC on 25 June 1999. The PA-RISC Linux Kernel is now integrated into 2.6 mainline ([http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/deller/parisc-linux.git parisc git tree]). 2.4 is nonetheless way out of sync with mainline (you need to use the [http://cvs.parisc-linux.org/download/linux-2.4/ CVS snapshot] to build it). Two linux distributions now support PA-RISC: Debian (since woody 3.0, released) and Gentoo (experimental). PA-RISC linux is not officially supported by HP.

== How does it work? ==

Palinux describes the project for getting Linux running on the PA-RISC processor. There are two elements: The [[LinuxKernel]] which supports the hardware and the user applications. A third piece is the boot loader (also known as PALO, the equivalent of LILO) which is part of the [[BootingSystem]].
