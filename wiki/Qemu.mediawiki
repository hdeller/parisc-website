== QEMU support status regarding hppa/parisc ==

Starting with QEMU version 2.12 (April 2018), qemu fully supports 32-bit hppa user emulation (hppa-linux-user) and 32-bit hppa system emulation (qemu-system-hppa).
All necessary changes have been merged into the [https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=summary upstream qemu git tree].

PA-RISC machines need a firmware ("PDC" = Processor Dependend Code).
Qemu includes a precompiled PDC firmware for hppa ([https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=pc-bios/hppa-firmware.img;h=86930974b9e12bec214fb464eee443a0d844e6ff;hb=HEAD pc-bios/hppa-firmware.img]), which is based on a [https://github.com/hdeller/seabios-hppa/commits/parisc_firmware fork of SeaBIOS ].

The emulated machine is a [https://www.openpa.net/systems/hp-visualize_b132l_b160l_b180l.html HP B160L desktop machine], with one or more 32-bit PA7100LC CPUs.

The QEMU emulation is able to run Linux and HP-UX. HP-UX support still needs improvement which is being worked on.

QEMU on parisc has been made available by:
* [mailto:rth@twiddle.net Richard Henderson]: QEMU CPU emulation (32-bit only), QEMU hardware divers
* [mailto:deller@gmx.de Helge Deller]: QEMU hardware drivers, SeaBIOS PDC firmware
* [mailto:svens@stackframe.org Sven Schnelle]: Lots of fixes all over QEMU and SeaBIOS (SCSI, CPU emulation fixes, SeaBIOS PDC firmware)

== Ready-to-run QEMU image for parisc ==

Download Debian hard disc image:
 wget http://backup.parisc-linux.org/qemu/debian-10-hdd-img.tar.bz2
Unzip image: 
 tar xvfj debian-10-hdd-img.tar.bz2
Run qemu:
 ./hppa-softmmu/qemu-system-hppa -drive file=debian-10-hdd.img -nographic -serial mon:stdio -accel tcg,thread=multi -smp cpus=4 
Log in as '''root''', root password is "'''rootme'''"

== How to build QEMU from source ==

Check out the [https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=summary qemu git tree]

Run configure, e.g.
* (for system emulation) '''./configure --target-list=hppa-softmmu --enable-numa'''
* (for user emulation) '''./configure --target-list=hppa-linux-user --disable-stack-protector --prefix=/home/qemu-hppa/chroot-unstable --interp-prefix=/home/qemu-hppa/chroot-unstable --static'''

Run "make"

== How to run QEMU with Debian-10 installer image ==

* Create a virtual hard disc once:
 qemu-img create -f qcow2 hdd.img 50G
* download a Linux install image, e.g.
** for debian: https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/10.0/hppa/iso-cd/debian-10.0-hppa-NETINST-1.iso
** for gentoo: http://distfiles.gentoo.org/releases/hppa/autobuilds/
* Start emulator with the installer image once:
 ./hppa-softmmu/qemu-system-hppa -drive file=hdd.img -drive file=debian-10.0-hppa-NETINST-1.iso,media=cdrom -boot order=d -nographic -serial mon:stdio 
* Choose typical installation options, the defaults are OK.
* Either skip the step "Configure the Package manager", or configure the mirror as with hostname "ftp.ports.debian.org", and directory "/debian-ports"
* Shut down virtual machine after installation

* Start emulator with installed operating system any time:
 ./hppa-softmmu/qemu-system-hppa -drive file=hdd.img -nographic -serial mon:stdio -accel tcg,thread=multi -smp cpus=2 

* Edit the sources.list (/etc/apt/sources.list) file:
 deb http://ftp.ports.debian.org/debian-ports unstable main
 deb [arch=all] http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main 
 deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian unstable main

== Some QEMU notes ==

Prefer the e1000 driver over the rtl8129 card. The latter gives irq issues with Dino emulation.

Possible qemu options:
* -accel tcg,thread=multi  - always use this to enable parallel tcg (otherwise all guest CPUs run on one host CPU)
* -smp cpus=4      - define number of CPUs in the guest (maximum CPUs: 32) 
* -boot menu=on    - Firmware: enable interactive mode (boot prompt)
* -boot order=c    - Firmware: Boot from hard disc
* -boot order=d    - Firmware: Boot from CD/DVD
* -serial mon:stdio   use serial console
* -nographic       - no graphics device
* -device VGA      - provide PCI VGA graphic card

== Tips and Tricks when running an emulation ==

* Linux kernel >= 4.14 runs best. Initial Linux kernel optimizations were added to kernel >= 4.9.
* The "INTERRUPT KEY" mentioned sometimes by HP-UX can be emulated with the "Ctrl-\" key combination
* In case you lost the HP-UX root password, boot at ISL 'hpux -is' and then give a new password with running "passwd".

== Possible emulation guest targets ==

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX HP-UX], versions 9.x up to 11.11
* Linux (Debian, Gentoo), latest releases (>= 4.14) preferred
* [https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/hppa/ NetBSD]
* [https://winworldpc.com/product/nextstep/3x NextSTEP]
* [ftp://ftp.cirr.com/pub/hppa/mklinux/ OSF/MkLinux]

== HP-UX ==

Still LASI NIC emulation and NCR 710 Emulation needed in order to be able to boot older HP-UX releases.

== OSF/MkLinux ==

Download at ftp://ftp.cirr.com/pub/hppa/mklinux/
The file root_ext2_g.dd.bin.gz doesn't cleanly decompress.. so I did a gzip -dc into root_ext2_g.dd.bin.

MkLinux sources: https://github.com/slp/osfmk-mklinux

 qemu-system-hppa -boot c -drive if=scsi,bus=0,index=3,file=root_ext2_g.dd.bin,format=raw \
        -serial mon:stdio -nographic -m 128 

It boots, but fails during device detection because Qemu currently emulates a B160, while MkLinux expects a HP700. So it fails to see the LASI chip below the GSC bridge.

== Future QEMU work ==

Upstream merging currently beeing worked on (September 2019):
* Emulate Lasi
* Emulate Lasi NIC (Intel Apricot i82596)
* Artist graphics emulation
* STI text console emulation for Linux and HP-UX
* Add PS/2 mouse and keyboard ports

Still need to do:
* Add Dino/Lasi serial port
* Harmony sound card in Lasi
* Does HP-UX has some kind of "sleep" assembler instruction in it's idle loop which can be used to lower qemu power consumption?
* Fix virtio-drivers in SeaBIOS (endianess-bugs, because SeaBIOS is originally only Little-endian from x86)
* Emulate Tulip (DEC 21x40) network cards in Qemu
* More correct emulation of B160L in Qemu
* Emulate a 712 and/or j5000/c3000 machine
* Emulate built-in LASI SCI controller instead of PCI SCSI add-on card
* Elroy PCI emulation, then emulate e.g. a C3000?
* PA2.0/64bit (low prio)
* ...
* '''Push SeaBIOS changes upstream!!'''
