== Introduction to Linux on PA-RISC ==

The PA-RISC project provides a ''native'' port of Linux to the PA-RISC architecture. The port was merged into linux-2.6 and linux-3.x mainstream Linux kernel tree.
[[PA-RISC Linux Project History]] tells how the project got started and the first steps.
Contact the [[Mailing lists]] if you want to volunteer your time.

See the [[Hall of Fame]] for a list of folks who brought you the initial 0.9x and Debian 3.0 releases.
That includes boot loader, kernel, documentation, user space programs, packaging, testing, debugging, and pulling everything together into an ISO.

== Linux distributions with support for PA-RISC Linux == 

PA-RISC Linux is currently supported by [http://wiki.parisc-linux.org/Distributions various Linux distributions], whith [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo Linux] and [http://www.debian.org Debian] being the ones which currently provide the best support for the PA-RISC architecture.

; Gentoo Linux:
: PA-RISC is a fully supported architecture of Gentoo Linux.<br>
: Many thanks to the smart people of the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/hppa Gentoo Linux HPPA Development team] for providing [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml Gentoo Linux installation ISOs available for download]!
: If you wish to install Gentoo Linux for PA-RISC, we suggest that your read the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-hppa.xml Handbook on how to install Gentoo Linux for PA-RISC].

; Debian Ports Linux:
: The PA-RISC Linux development community is proud to have been officially part of the Debian 3.1 (sarge), 4.0 (etch) and 5.0 (lenny) releases.
: As of Debian 6.0 (squeeze) PA-RISC Linux was sadly dropped in July 2011 as officially supported platform which is why the PA-RISC Linux development currently happens as Debian-unofficial architecture in the [http://www.debian-ports.org Debian Ports] project. Our Wiki contains a description on [[Debian Ports Installation]].
 
'''Before downloading any ISOs for Gentoo, Debian or any other Linux distribution, first check the
[[PARISC FAQ]] and [[Hardware support]] for issues specific to your hardware.'''
