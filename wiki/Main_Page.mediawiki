== Introduction to Linux on PA-RISC ==

The PA-RISC project provides a ''native'' port of Linux to the PA-RISC architecture. The port was merged into linux-2.6 and linux-3.x mainstream Linux kernel tree.
[[PA-RISC Linux Project History]] tells how the project got started and the first steps.
Contact the [[Mailing lists]] if you want to volunteer your time.

See the [[Hall of Fame]] for a list of folks who brought you the initial 0.9x and Debian 3.0 releases.
That includes boot loader, kernel, documentation, user space programs, packaging, testing, debugging, and pulling everything together into an ISO.

== Linux distributions with support for PA-RISC Linux == 

PA-RISC Linux is currently supported by [http://wiki.parisc-linux.org/Distributions various Linux distributions], whith [http://www.gentoo.org Gentoo Linux] and [http://www.debian.org Debian] being the ones which currently provide the best support for the PA-RISC architecture.

; Gentoo Linux:
: PA-RISC is a fully supported architecture of Gentoo Linux.<br>
: Many thanks to the smart people of the [http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/hppa Gentoo Linux HPPA Development team] for providing [http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/where.xml Gentoo Linux installation ISOs available for download]!
: If you wish to install Gentoo Linux for PA-RISC, we suggest that your read the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-hppa.xml Handbook on how to install Gentoo Linux for PA-RISC].

; Debian Linux:
: The PA-RISC Linux development community is proud to have been officially part of the Debian 3.1 (sarge), 4.0 (etch) and 5.0 (lenny) releases.
: As of Debian 6.0 (squeeze) PA-RISC Linux was dropped in July 2011 as officially supported platform which is why the PA-RISC Linux development currently happens as Debian-unofficial architecture in the [http://www.debian-ports.org Debian Ports] project. 
: This Wiki contains a [[Debian Ports Installation | description on how to install Debian Linux]].
 
'''Before downloading any ISOs for Gentoo, Debian or any other Linux distribution, first check the
[[PARISC FAQ]] and [[Hardware support]] for issues specific to your hardware.'''

== PA-RISC NEWS == 
* '''Jun 2014''' - The A500-44 is up and running as additional debian buildd server at parisc.osuosl.org. Kernel 3.15 is out. Added a very fast 4-way 1GHz C8000 machine with 250GB SATA SSD drive as additional Debian buildd server (sibaris.parisc-linux.org), machine and hosting sponsored by Németh Bálint. New functional [[Debian Ports Installation | installer images available to install Debian unstable]].
* '''May 2014''' - More than 9900 debian packages built. Kernel 3.15 will be the most best kernel ever. The A500 (mkhppa3) buildd which was sponsored and hosted by ESIEE sadly died.
* '''Apr 2014''' - The PARISC boot loader palo is back in debian unstable. More than 9750 debian packages built.
* '''Mar 2014''' - The A500-44 which hosted our main webpage is being moved to OSUOSL.org. More than 9500 debian packages built.
* '''Feb 2014''' - The new parisc Wiki is now at http://parisc.wiki.kernel.org. Contents of the old Wiki at wiki.parisc-linux.org was moved and the webpage redirects here.
* '''Jan 2014''' - Updated [[Debian_Ports_Installation|Debian unstable install instructions]]. More than [http://buildd.debian-ports.org/stats 8000 newly built native Debian packages] available.
* '''Dec 2013''' - [http://unstable.buildd.net/index-hppa.html 5 buildd servers for debian unstable online]. The servers hpviz and rio including hosting are sponsored by Dave Land - http://landcomp.net. Stable Debian kernel 3.12 available. 
* '''Aug 2013''' - Linux kernel 3.11 supports C8000 workstation (SMP, serial port, FireGL card, BMC, ...)
* '''Apr 2013''' - Website updated, added [[Debian_Ports_Installation|Debian ports installation instructions]] and updated [[TODO]] list.
* '''Mar 2013''' - Debian 7.0 (wheezy) without HPPA.
* '''Feb 2013''' - Many PA-RISC Linux kernel patches have been integrated into Kernel 3.8. Stability will improve even further with kernel 3.9.
* '''Feb 2012''' - Website is back up! Work continues on the debian-ports support for HPPA.
* '''Sep 2010''' - HPPA dropped as an official release architecture for squeeze.
* '''Sep 2009''' - NPTL transition is ready, thanks to the efforts of Carlos!

* '''Jul 2006''' - James fixes (mostly) parisc-linux on PA8800! w00t!
* '''Mar 2006''' - Fixed stifb on 64-bit machines. X now works with a 64-bit kernel!
* '''Dec 2005''' - Fixed framebuffer console on 32bit HCRX graphic cards
* '''Dec 2005''' - PCMCIA support added (e.g. used in Tadpole PA-RISC laptops)
* '''Jun 2005''' - Debian 3.1!
* '''Mar 2005''' - The parisc-linux patch set is less than 200K for the first time ever! Thanks to willy for doing such a great job pushing patches upstream!
