= PA-RISC Processor Registers =

Register usage for Linux/PA-RISC is documented in the Linux kernel source tree in 
the file Documentation/parisc/registers:

= PA-RISC Space Registers and How to use them =

== Instructions ==
There are two types of instruction which reference memory; those with
2-bit '`s`' fields and those with 3-bit '`s`' fields.

Instructions with a 3-bit `s` field are straightforward.  The value of
the `s` field directly specifies which of the 8 space registers to use.

Instructions with a 2-bit `s` field have two cases.  If `s` is 1-3, we use
the corresponding space register (`sr1-sr3`).  If the value in the `s` field
is 0, we do not use space register 0.  Instead, we use one of `sr4-7` as
determined by the top two bits of the '''base register'''.

== In Linux ==
In Linux, `sr4-7` are always set to the same value.  When in kernel space,
they are 0.  In user space, they have the value for the task we're
currently executing.

What we were trying to do in `pacache.S` was use an instruction (flush
instruction cache) as if it were a 2-bit-s instruction when it's actually
a 3-bit-s instruction.  This led to the processor using `sr0` instead of
one of `sr4-7`.  The assembler now errors on this case, causing us to find
a bug.

Just to make things harder, there is a 2-bit-s version of flush
instruction cache, but it's only available on pa2.0 processors, so we
don't want to use it.  Instead we use `sr4` (since `sr4-7` all have the same
value in Linux).
