title: Debian Ports Installation

= Installation of PA-RISC Linux  =

HPPA became an officially supported Debian architecture in release 3.0 (woody) and was dropped as of stable release 6.0 (squeeze).
That's the reason that the latest available official installation CDs are available for Debian 5.0 (lenny) only.

The Debian ports project hosts a parisc version of debian unstable.
Today the recommended installation of a new parisc machine is via the debian-ports unstable respository at http://debian-ports.org as described in the following section.

If you want to install debian the hard way with many manual steps, you can read the instructions at [[Debian_Ports_Installation_Manual]].

== Installation of Debian unstable via debian-ports repository ==

The latest debian-7.0-hppa-CD-1.iso file for installation of Debian unstable is available at either one of the following locations:
* http://parisc.osuosl.org/debian-cd/
* http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian-cd/
* http://landcomp.net:884/debian/debian-cd/

This ISO file you can:
 * either burn to a CD, or
 * boot it via tftpboot/bootp, or
 * use "dd" to copy it to an empty hard disc drive and tell IPL to boot from it.

Instructions to install:
* If your machine is behind a firewall, enter the proxy at the IPL command line the Linux kernel command line (change parameter 7):
   mirror/http/proxy=http://proxy:8080   (adjust the proxy settings to your need and drop the underscores)
* At the "Software selection" screen, do not enable other software than "SSH server" yet. You can install additional software later!
* When the installation finished, do not press "Continue" to reboot the machine, but instead choose "Go Back" and then in the main menu choose to execute a shell. In the shell type the following command to enable serial console (needed e.g. for boot console on GSP):
  echo "T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS0 9600 vt100" >> /target/etc/inittab
* Type "exit" to quit the shell and return to the main menu.
* In the main menu choose to "Finish the installation" and let it reboot the machine.

Notes:
* After reboot the sshd daemon will not accept password-logins for root. You may need to log in as user and then become root via "su -". To change the sshd behaviour, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and change the value of PermitRootLogin to yes.
