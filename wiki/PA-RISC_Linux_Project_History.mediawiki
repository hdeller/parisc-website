; December 1, 2000  
: The PA-RISC web site has moved to www.parisc-linux.org domain. Besides the appearance of the Linuxcare penguin Lux (in gear suitable for working on the PA-RISC engine), the PA-RISC site is fresh with a content update, face lift and co-branding with HP.

; December 15, 1999
: The Puffin Group and Linuxcare join forces, providing us all with additional resources and backing to dedicate to the porting effort. In fact, we are now working even more closely with Hewlett-Packard. While we were in California getting all the details sorted out, a number of people posted to the mailing list with concerns that the project was dead. This couldn't be further from the truth. Martin Fink from HP posted the following message to help clear up the misunderstanding: http://puffin.external.hp.com/mailing-lists/parisc-linux/1999/12-Dec/0073.html.
