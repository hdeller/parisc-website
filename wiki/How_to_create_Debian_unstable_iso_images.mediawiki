title: How to create Debian unstable iso images
---

PA-RISC is not any longer an official Debian distribution and as such, Debian ISO install images are not produced any longer by the Debian developers.

This website describes the basic steps how you can create such images yourself.
The instructions should - with minor modifcations - work for other architectures like alpha or sparc too.


== What you need to know ==
: Prebuilt debian unstable packages are available at the repository at http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian/
: In most cases it's not possible to install from the debian ports repository, because
# it is a moving target, which means that the Linux kernel udeb packages which are needed by the kernel on the ISO/liffile may not be available any longer at a later date, and
# the bootloader (e.g. palo for parisc, aboot for alpha, silo for sparc) is not available there (because those architectures are not any longer release architectures, so the bootloaders are not being built any long), and 
# the partitioning tools during installation for the architecture might be missing for the same reason (e.g. partman-palo for parisc).

== Basic steps ==
# Create a local copy of the debian-ports repository
# Build the debian-installer packages
# Add missing boot loader / partitioning tools packages to the repository
# Build the final iso image

=== Create a local copy of the debian-ports repository ===
# Install reprepro (apt-get install reprepro)
# Create a directory which will hold the copied packages (around 60 GB storage needed!)

  apt-get install reprepro
  
  mkdir -p /extra/deller/debian-alpha-archive/
  cd /extra/deller/debian-alpha-archive/
  
  wget https://parisc.wiki.kernel.org/images-parisc/2/26/Reprepro-conf-alpha.zip
  unzip Reprepro-conf-alpha.zip
  rm Reprepro-conf-alpha.zip
  
  # now modify the files in conf/* to your needs
  # now run "reprepro update" to pull all files from debian-ports
  reprepro update

=== Build the debian-installer packages ===
# Read [https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/CheckOut|on how to check out the debian installer]. It's done below.

  apt-get install mr subversion
  apt-get build-dep debian-installer
  mkdir -p /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER/{TEMP,bootstrap}
  
  # See: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/CheckOut
  cd /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER/
  svn co svn://anonscm.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk debian-installer
  cd debian-installer
  scripts/git-setup
  mr -p checkout
  
  # check out other packes for your architecture into the packages directory
  # for a list see here: https://alioth.debian.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?a=project_list;pf=d-i
  
  cd /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER/debian-installer/packages
  
  # for alpha:
  git clone https://anonscm.debian.org/git/d-i/attic/aboot.git
  git clone https://anonscm.debian.org/git/d-i/attic/aboot-installer.git
  # for parisc:
  git clone https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/d-i/attic/palo-installer.git
  git clone https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/d-i/attic/partman-palo.git
  # for sparc:
  git clone https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/d-i/attic/silo-installer.git
  
  # then build the debian-installer with all packages
  cd /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER/debian-installer/installer
  export ONLINE=n
  dpkg-buildpackage

=== Add boot loader installer and partitioning tools packages to the repository ===
The architecture-specific packages (palo-installer, silo-installer, ...) were built above.
Install them into your local reprepro archive directory
  cd /extra/deller/debian-alpha-archive/
  reprepro includeudeb unstable /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER/debian-installer/installer/build/apt.udeb/cache/archives/*udeb

=== Build your platform boot loader ===
Build the boot loader for your platform (palo, silo, ...) and install the deb package 
as done above (use includedeb instead of includeudeb). 
  cd /extra/deller/debian-alpha-archive/
  reprepro includedeb unstable <path_to_your_bootloader>

=== Set up debian-cd ===
debian-cd will build the installer images.
Download it, configure it and let it build the image:

  cd /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER
  git clone https://alioth.debian.org/anonscm/git/debian-cd/debian-cd.git
  
  # patch debian-cd
  cd debian-cd
  wget https://parisc.wiki.kernel.org/images-parisc/2/2e/Debian-cd.patch.txt
  patch -p1 -s < Debian-cd.patch.txt
  # after patching check changes with "git diff" and modify as needed
  # adjust the kernel options (KERNEL_PARAMS in CONF.sh)

=== Build the final iso image ===

  cd /extra/deller/DEBIAN_INSTALLER/debian-cd
  
  ./easy-build.sh NETINST $HOSTTYPE
  ./easy-build.sh CD $HOSTTYPE
