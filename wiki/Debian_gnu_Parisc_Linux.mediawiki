== Debian GNU/Linux 9 and 10 for the PA-RISC (hppa) architecture. ==
There are two unofficial releases of Debian GNU/Linux for PA-RISC machines based on the stable (Stretch) and testing (Buster) branches. The packages included in both releases have been pulled from the unstable (Sid) branch located at the [http://www.debian-ports.org Debian Ports] repository. The security and bug fixes for the stable release have been built from the official Debian source repositories.
