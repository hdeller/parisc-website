= Known Issues with the PA-RISC Linux Kernel =

This page lists known limitations of the current implementation of the PA-RISC Linux '''kernel'''. If not mentioned otherwise, this list applies to the latest GIT version (at the time of this writing this means version 2.6.22-rc2).
Please note that this list is likely to be incomplete and is NOT meant to be a [[TODO]] or "wanted features" page! BTW, if you think you have found a bug not listed here then please report it to the PA-RISC Linux mailing list.

Some of the issues described here might never be resolved, partly due to the fact that documentation is unavailable/missing, it would not fit with the current kernel design or there is simply lack of manpower.

Also keep an eye on the [[hotspots]] and the available [[TestCases]]

== Missing/Incomplete PA-RISC specific Drivers ==

* VisualizeFX graphics cards
** No graphics support written, cards can only be used in text mode via the sticon driver. There is interest in a driver being written, but because no programming documentation has been released by HP this will be a difficult task. There is a reverse engineering attempt on [[VisualizeFX]].
* Accelerated X11 support for Visualize-EG graphics cards
** So far there is only basic framebuffer support via stifb. Lack of [[DocumentationWishList|manuals]]/time. Anyway, an acceleration support for [[NGLE]] cards is in progress.
* HP-PB bus and HP-PB cards
** This bus system and type of cards are mainly used on old HP9000/800 servers. Much of the programming manuals are not available, and since there is not much demand to support such old machines progress for these devices is almost non-existent (although some brave souls have been seen hacking on them from time to time)
* ccio and ncr53c8xx (ncr53c720) - apparently not 64 bit clean
* ns87415 - DMA support doesn't seem to work (transfer speeds <=3MB/s)
* snd_ad1889 - playing music with alsa native interface produces garbled sound, OSS emu does work however. This is because alsa native use mmap on the device, which parisc-linux doesn't support (yet).
* EISA DMA support is not implemented yet
* PCI-to-PCI bridge issue (loop in `/proc/iomem` `/proc/ioports`)

== Broken Device Drivers and File Systems ==

Hardware drivers, networking support, file systems etc. that are expected to work on all supported architectures of the Linux kernel, but don't function properly on PA-RISC Linux:

* matroxfb - 64 bit kernel issue: screen stays black, i.e. graphics card is not properly initialized  <-- HAS THIS BEEN FIXED?
* Promise IDE P-ATA controller (PDC202XX_NEW) - DMA issues, but booting with 'nodma' works. Try a siimage controller if you really need IDE.

== Other Missing Features (related to palo, glibc, userspace etc.) ==

* 64 bit userland, missing bits:
** 64 bit binutils that will build DSO's
** 64 bit glibc
** Multiple stub sections for the 64 bit linker.
* Low latency
* XFree86/X.org BIOS init emulation support
* MSI/MSI-X PCI device support
