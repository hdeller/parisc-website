~~~~~~~~
- Reached `12.000 pre-built debian packages <http://buildd.debian.org/status/architecture.php?a=hppa&suite=sid>`__.

Oct 2020
~~~~~~~~
- In Kernel 5.10 O_NONBLOCK was changed to become 000200000 (instead of
  000200004). This is a binary ABI change and requires userspace (glibc,
  dietlibc, systemd) to be recompiled with the new value. The kernel has
  wrapper functions which provide backwards compatibility.

Aug 2020
~~~~~~~~
- `Roger Sayle <mailto:roger@nextmovesoftware.com>`__ fixed a

  updates.

Jan 2019
~~~~~~~~
- Debian kernel 4.20 will ship built as SMP kernel only (for 32- and
  64-bit), which then patches itself at bootup to run faster on
  uniprocessor machines if it detects only one CPU.
- The OSUOSL team was so nice to upgrade the debian buildd servers:
  "parisc" has now two 300 GB (instead of two 68 GB) and panama three
  300 GB (instead of two 18 GB) SCSI discs. Thanks!

Nov 2018
~~~~~~~~
- A new complete `parisc-linux mailing list archive is now available at
  lore.kernel.org <http://lore.kernel.org/linux-parisc/>`__. It even
  contains the `very first parisc-linux mail
  <http://lore.kernel.org/linux-parisc/Pine.LNX.4.04.9901291134480.1532-100000@sprite.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/>`__.
- Linux kernel 4.20 includes the `"alternative"-feature which enables us
  to do live-patching of the kernel code at bootup time
  <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3847dab77421867fbc77faacb2f377d44e729e1b>`__.
  With this feature we will be able to build a SMP kernel which is
  patched at boottime to run faster on a UP system.

Sep 2018
~~~~~~~~
- Reached `11.700 pre-built debian unstable packages <http://buildd.debian.org/status/architecture.php?a=hppa&suite=sid>`__.

  via built-in BMC controller <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c6185e285c5c7cfeab739bae7f206ced695f09c7>`__.

Mar 2018
~~~~~~~~
- New documentation on how to access the :doc:`Baseboard Management
  Controller (BMC) in rp34x0 and C8000 machines <bmc>`.

Feb 2018
~~~~~~~~
- `QEMU 2.12 supports parisc system-emulation (qemu-system-hppa)
  <Qemu>`__ thanks to `contributions by Richard Henderson and Helge
  Deller <https://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b05631954d6dfe93340d516660397e2c1a2a5dd6>`__.

Jan 2018
~~~~~~~~
- New `palo bootloader v2.00 released
  <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/deller/palo.git/>`__.
  The callee copies ABI of gcc (on 32-bit hppa) created lots of
  optimization issues and problems with OpenMP, so `Dave committed a
  patch to switch to the caller copy ABI
  <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2018-01/msg01518.html>`__ instead.
- First Qemu-related `patches to Linux kernel to reduce power
  consumption on the host <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=310d82784fb4d60c80569f5ca9f53a7f3bf1d477>`__
  have been submitted and the Qemu hardware emulation works fully stable
  with a booted Linux. Even an emulated 32-CPU PA-RISC SMP machine was
  running stable.

Dec 2017
~~~~~~~~
- Development on parisc hardware emulation via qemu is ongoing. Richard
  Henderson maintains the `hppa qemu git tree
  <https://github.com/rth7680/qemu/commits/tgt-hppa-softmmu>`__ while
  Helge Deller works on a `parisc IODC and PDC firmware emulation via a
  SeaBIOS fork <https://github.com/hdeller/seabios-hppa/commits/parisc_firmware>`__.
  The emulation already boots a Debian install CD, runs through whole
  kernel initialization code and even runs quite far into the init
  process.

Sep 2017
~~~~~~~~
- New Debian-9 installer image is now available at `official cdimage
  places <https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/>`__. Many thanks to

  the UBSAN checker and kernel self-decompressor.

Aug 2017
~~~~~~~~
- Kernel 4.13 includes initial Page Deallocation Table (PDT) support to
  avoid using broken memory by the Linux kernel.
- Dave submitted all outstanding patches for hppa to glibc v2.26.
  Linuxthread support was dropped and switched to the generic nptl
  support instead. Unwinding was fixed to support pthread cancellation.
- Thomas Bogendoerfer fixed the PCI memory bar assignment on Dino/Cujo
  machines and as such got ATI graphic cards to work on such machines.
- New `palo bootloader v1.99 released
  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/deller/palo.git/>`__
  which fixes problems when loading huge kernels, e.g. with kernel UBSAN
  support enabled.

  :doc:`one 800 MHz PA8900 CPU which we upgraded to 5 GB RAM and added a 146
  GB hard disc <rp3410>`. The server is now reachable as
  `panama.parisc-linux.org <https://monitor.jrtc27.com/>`__ and acts as
  a debian buildd machine. `Hosting is sponsored by OSU Open Source Lab
  <http://osuosl.org/>`__. Thanks to all people involved, especially to

December 1, 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The PA-RISC web site has moved to www.parisc-linux.org domain. Besides
the appearance of the Linuxcare penguin Lux (in gear suitable for
working on the PA-RISC engine), the PA-RISC site is fresh with a content
update, face lift and co-branding with HP.

December 15, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Puffin Group and Linuxcare join forces, providing us all with
additional resources and backing to dedicate to the porting effort. In
fact, we are now working even more closely with Hewlett-Packard. While
we were in California getting all the details sorted out, a number of
people posted to the mailing list with concerns that the project was
dead. This couldn't be further from the truth. Martin Fink from HP
posted the following message to help clear up the misunderstanding:
http://puffin.external.hp.com/mailing-lists/parisc-linux/1999/12-Dec/0073.html.

November 19, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hewlett-Packard, in cooperation with The Puffin Group, has released the
source code to their SOM linker product.

August 16, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The source code repository is now `cross-referenced
<http://puffin.external.hp.com/lxr/source>`__ online.

July 6, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Philipp Rumpf gets interruptions working, you can now enter them and the
system returns from them.

June 26-27, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Matthew Wilcox and Thomas Bogendoerfer in cooperation with HP
demonstrate the booting Linux kernel at LinuxTag '99 in Kaiserslautern,
Germany.

June 25, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Helge Deller boots the first time Linux on a 715/64 PA-RISC machine
which promptly dies after displaying kernel version information. Much
celebration.

May 19-24, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Puffin Group hosts Bird of Feather session at Linux Expo, and
participates in HP's booth. Tremendous interest and support shown for
the project.

May 15, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~
HP, through the The Puffin Group, distributes A180C machines to developers.

March 9, 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HP releases first round of documentation on the basic boot up sequence
and PDC interfaces. See the [/documentation/index.html Documentation]
section on this page.

March 1999
~~~~~~~~~~
Hewlett-Packard Formally Sponsors Project - At Linux World Expo on March
1st, HP officially announces its support and endorsement of the PARISC
Linux project. They promised to provide marketing and technical
resources to the project, and talks began towards releasing
documentation and hardware through The Puffin Group.

HP, in conjunction with The Puffin Group, releases documents - On March
9th, HP releases documentation regarding the basic bootup sequence and
PDC interfaces. See the [/documentation/index.html Documentation]
section.

February 1999
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Establishing the Framework - Christopher Beard sets up the web pages and
mailing lists, with Phil Schwan configuring the CVS repository. The web
pages are then added to several Linux development sites, and there is a
noticable increase in interest in the project.

The Cross-Compiler - Paul Lahaie joins the project, working with Alex
