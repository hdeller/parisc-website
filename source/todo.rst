==================================

Kernel
------

- Check graphics drivers / VisualizeFX with drivers from NetBSD - see mail thread
  "Graphics support" from Michael Lorenz on 12/16/24 https://lore.kernel.org/linux-parisc/20241216064156.6bbe1330@bushmills/
  Note: NetBSD drm manpage at https://man.netbsd.org/drm.4 says:
  drm is large and complicated and has no shortage of bugs.  On systems where
  graphics is not important, you may wish to use userconf(4) to dis- able the
  special-purpose drm drivers for your graphics device and fall back to vga(4) or
  genfb(4) with the default display configuration pro- vided by firmware.

  work for QEMU through his company.

- Fix migration of VMs (noticed by: Mark Cave-Ayland
  <mark.cave-ayland@ilande.co.uk>): Boot a qcow2 image in QEMU using the

QEMU user-mode emulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Building curl hangs at end of package build in stunnel

- STARTED: kronosnet - port SCTP to qemu

- ONGOING: qemu-user brk() fixes:

    - brk testcase in qemu commit: 4d1de87c75007ee7e29dd271ebb4afdcf01ad7aa

- check qemu-user build errors:

  - qemu can not emulate robust mutexes. That's why lmdb package and dependend
    packages like neomutt fail to build because the
    pthread_mutexattr_setpshared(PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED) call fails.
    Solution: Allow lmdb to fall back to MDB_USE_POSIX_SEM.

  - Check why raft package testcases fail

  - It looks like haskell packages still fail on qemu (e.g.,
    haskell-swish).

- Add backtrace() function to glibc -> needed to build dovecot package

- DONE: Improve text on https://www.openpa.net

- STARTED: port :doc:`Gccgo_for_hppa <gccgo_for_hppa>` gccgo -> https://github.com/hdeller/gcc/tree/gccgo-hppa

executable stack
----------------

TODO: Convert gcc nested function trampoline
(pa_asm_trampoline_template) to don't need an executable stack

(see https://lore.kernel.org/all/87lebjz9z6.fsf@gentoo.org/) Starting
with Kernel 5.18, the parisc Linux kernel gained support to run without
executable stacks. In gcc-14 GNU stack notes were enabled. An executable
stack is still needed by applications for nested functions. They are
still called via a stack trampoline. The GNU stack note indicates
whether an object needs an executable stack or not. These notes are
collected by linker. The glibc loader determines whether to setup an
executable stack or not.

Once gcc-14 becomes the default compiler, we will have to enable GNU
stack notes in previous gcc versions. We will still have executable
stacks until everything is rebuilt. We will need to update that default
in Binutils too. Currently (nov 2023), there are no architecture
dependencies in the ld --enable-warn-execstack and
--enable-default-execstack configure options. The -z execstack and -z
noexecstack ld options can override the GNU notes, or lack thereof. We
may have to fix some assembly code. Maybe binutils should be built with
--enable-warn-execstack once we switch to gcc-14. I don't think we want
--enable-default-execstack after switching to gcc-14.

Debian
------

- ask to get palo-installer, partman-palo, aboot-installer into
  debian-installer (import from old Git-Backup, Alex Wirt?) - Mail from
  Adrian 05/30/23

- STARTED: Fix initramfs: Bug#1027915: systemd requires /run to be
  mounted with a minimum size of 20MB:
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1027915, patch sent

- STARTED: Activate LARGE FILE SUPPORT generally on hppa:
  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1020335

gcc compiler
------------

- Why is compiling fife so slow with cc1plus?

- asked Dave to implement gcc builtins for break asms, like on other
  platforms, for usage in kernel

- SeaBIOS and palo: muldi3 and divdi3 (from libgcc.a) trashes fr22-fr25
  because of xmpyu instruction. Doesn't seem to have negative effect,
  but those registers should better be saved/restored in pdc_entry() and
  iodc_entry(), or libgcc should be fixed to not use floating point
  instructions.

- STARTED: Port grub2 to hppa? -> https://github.com/hdeller/grub

- INEQUIVALENT ALIASES occur building gnuradio on debian.

- STARTED: convert old-style rtc driver drivers/input/misc/hp_sdc_rtc.c
  to new RTC model, remove the procfs and miscdevice interfaces first
  and replace the ioctl with a struct rtc_class_ops. Arnd Bergmann can
  review those patches, but Alexandre and Alessandro are the ones who
  would merge them once the driver is moved to drivers/rtc. (Mail from
  Arnd Bergmann, 28.04.2016) - see https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10701397/

- Add some cond_resched() calls to avoid RCU stalls, see commit
  2a8bc5316adc998951e8f726c31e231a6021eae2

- Check if https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/23/1246 was added to avoid TLB
  stalls (commits https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c6fe44d96fc1536af5b11cd859686453d1b7bfd1
  and https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2a9127fcf2296674d58024f83981f40b128fffea) - kernel v5.9 seems good.

JAVA
----

- Finish OpenJDK, see patch and mail from Adrian Glaubitz 05.02.2021.

- IMPORTANT: fix OpenJDK - fixes required in zeroport (stack grows up!).

Rust language
-------------

- STARTED:
  https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/compare/master...hdeller:libc:hppa-devel2

- From Adrian Glaubitz (9/29/2021): The Rust project merged a change [1]
  that allows rustc to use GCC instead of LLVM as codegen backend for
  generating machine code through libgccjit. This means that we are in
  principal able now to build Rust code for all the architectures that
  GCC support but LLVM doesn't, which includes hppa. Please see this [2]
  and this [3] comment to see how to get started with cross-building the
  Rust compiler for a new target using libgccjit. We will have to add
  these new architectures to the libc crate first, see an example PR for
  that here [4]. Since I can't work on all these targets myself, I
  wanted to ask you to help me and get the support for hppa added to
  libc and rustc where necessary.

  - [1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87260
  - [2] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87260#issuecomment-930221503
  - [3] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87260#issuecomment-930223504
  - [4] https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/2414

- In debian, stunnel4 requires python-cryptography package, and that was
  needed by something else I forgot...

gcc compiler
------------

- \_mcount can be optimized (smaller) by not subtracting offset)

- check if we can use -fentry from gcc for \_mcount optimization

- put PLABELS into read-only section (gcc function pa_reloc_rw_mask()
  needs modification, see "section mismatches" mails, 11.09.2017)

- gcc: Add \_builtin_thread_pointer() and
  \_builtin_set_thread_pointer(), e.g.:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-07/msg00428.html for glibc:
  ports/sysdeps/hppa/nptl/tls.h \__set_cr27()

- STARTED: why is GNU AS so slow, e.g. when building freeorion,
  quantlib-swig or yade packages, testcases: openturns

- http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=787192

- https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18427

- provide libphobos packages - gcc-defaults -
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763103, Work by Dave:
  https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/2018-11/msg03460.html

- gcc -> join 32- and 64bit compiler, make "-m64" work, get rid of
  hppa64-linux-gnu-gcc

- **64-bit userspace support (from Dave Anglin, Nick Hudson)**

- 64-bit userspace, :doc:`Binutils <binutils>` 64-bit binutils needs to
  be fixed to get multiple stub section support.

- glibc port (hppa64 can use the generic thread code)

- 64-bit support in gcc is probably pretty good as 64-bit HP-UX works
  fine.

- gdb could be a problem due to a lack of a maintainer.

- debian parisc perl bug
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=721537) shows that
  mmap on parisc linux is horribly inefficient. We allocate huge maps
  for small files. This should be improved. Mailthread: " parisc mmap:
  private file maps",
  http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-parisc/msg05083.html or
  https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119567
  https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=119567

kernel work
-----------

- ALPHA processor port:

  - Add https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/14/259 aboot patch

  - New one: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10141217/ (alpha: fix
    crash if pthread_create races with signal delivery)

  - Kernel patches: http://marc.info/?t=140610652200001&r=1&w=2, The
    proposed fix is in: http://marc.info/?t=140675670100010&r=1&w=2,
    http://marc.info/?t=142327510200001&r=1&w=2

- How to upgrade libgcc
  ::

    apt install -f -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-overwrite"

  see: https://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/08/01/understanding-dpkgs-file-overwrite-error/

- Kernel: Hard to solve outstanding issues

- megaraid on my rp5470 hangs at boot (maybe because SCSI chassis not
  connected)? -> use new megaraid driver for debian -> maybe patch
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7738911/ needed to enable PCI-PCI
  bridge?

- Fix FireGL X1/X3 in C8000 - currently broken (no DRM and software
  accel is incredibly slow [STRIKEOUT:plus colors in 24bpp mode are
  wrong] seems ok in debian 8 sid / 3.16.7 kernel) - Info: manual
  "Radeon R5xx Acceleration" -
  http://www.x.org/docs/AMD/R5xx_Acceleration_v1.1.pdf and generic:
  http://www.botchco.com/agd5f/?p=50

- Kernel: still missing Linux kernel development (no patches available
  yet or maybe not possible to implement):

- maybe: optimize flush_dcache_page() implementation like sparc. See
  Documentation/cachetlb.txt, e.g. used in aio subsystem

- maybe implement transparent huge pages (due to cache coherency
  technically only possible on PA8500-PA8700 CPUs, not possible on
  PA8800-PA8900 CPUs)

- implement BUG() and WARN() with inline assembly so that interrupt
  happens in delay branch of "or,<> %r0,cond,%r0". Probably not
  possible, because gcc will report "control reaches end of non-void
  function" warnings/errors.

- disable FP-register save/restore at kernel entry? -
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/3975291/

- enable 16k/64k kernel page sizes (still cacheflushing-issues with SCSI
  driver, additional work in glibc needed to deal with >4k page size,
  e.g. ld-loader alignments of data/code segments)

- Superdome support - can someone test? Should work better now with
  latest kernels (maybe ask Dennis Clarke <dclarke@blastwave.org>, Jan
  2019).

Debian packages / Userspace work
--------------------------------

- Various big endian issues, see mail thread "s390x architecture status?": https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2024/10/msg00295.html

- WebKitGTK still builds in s390x, but the Skia graphics library does not support big-endian machines so if the Cairo backend is ever dropped then we probably won't be able to support s390x any longer:  https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/webkitgtk-2.47.1/Source/ThirdParty/skia/include/private/base/SkLoadUserConfig.h#L56

- teach "blkid" about palo partition

- glibc: add backtrace() function, problems when building elfutils
  package: http://buildd.debian-ports.org/status/package.php?p=elfutils&suite=sid
  and dovecot https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=dovecot&arch=hppa&ver=1%3A2.3.19.1%2Bdfsg1-2%2Bb1&stamp=1666756774&raw=0

- Circular dependency problems with kde packages caused by vlc and
  ffmpeg (Dave)

- Solution: Rebuild ffmpeg outside the buildd (as some dependencies have
  probably been deleted) and upload a +b1 version. Then trigger bin-nmu
  of phonon package. Finally this resolves then the dependencies of vlc,
  ffmpeg, phonon, chromaprint, polkit-kde-agent-1, kwrited, kwallet-kf5
  and libkf5notifications-dev...

- Due to very bad performance running multiple copies of dot program
  (Dave)

- In vtk6 debian package, adding DOT_NUM_THREADS = 1 helps.

- Floating point NaN (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN)

- PA-RISC uses "mips" NaN format which differs from x86, etc. It should
  be called PA-RISC format as I think PA was first. The quiet NaN bit is
  opposite to than in current IEEE standard.

- Debian packages with NaN issues: libime, `capnproto
  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=781787>`__,
  `python-shapely <https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=python-shapely&arch=hppa&ver=2.0.6-4%2Bb1&stamp=1735949853&raw=0>`__

palo (PA-RISC Boot Loader)
--------------------------

- PALO - add regular rewind & load to avoid tftp boot timing issues. See
  mail from Frank Schreiner "PALO issues" (Dec 2018).

- When listing directory contents, resolve and print symlink target file
  names too, e.g. "vmlinux -> linux-5.12.1-64bit".

- Fix palo deb package to build iplboot natively
  (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=851792)

- Modify (if possible), that palo can read (sequential)
  tftpbootable-vmlinuxes as well as the current boot-vmlinux images
  (simplifies build/handling)

.. _abi_breakages_e.g._dropped_hp_ux_support:

ABI breakages (e.g. dropped HP-UX support)
------------------------------------------

- **Kernel 3.14 (EWOULDBLOCK)**

  - `We dropped HP-UX support in kernel 3.14 by changing EWOULDBLOCK==EAGAIN. <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=f5a408d53edef3af07ac7697b8bc54a755628450>`__ HP-UX could be run in a VM instead or since machines are relatively cheap now, if someone needs hpux, they can buy a machine for it (or use qemu)

- **Kernel 3.16 (SIGRTMIN)**

  - `Changed SIGRTMIN to 32 (from 37) <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1f25df2eff5b25f52c139d3ff31bc883eee9a0ab>`__
  - `debian glibc report <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=766605>`__ and `debian kernel bug report <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=766635>`__
  - September 7th 2014: First delivery with vmlinux-3.16.0-4 (aka linux-image-3.16.0-4-parisc64-smp_3.16.7-1_hppa.deb)
  - How to install:

    - Install the new glibc debian package, then install systemd, then install the new kernel package (this will create a new initrd), reboot

  - rebuild of the following packages was needed:

    - unxz-utils: rebuild unxz to fix usage of SIGXFSZ
    - strace and gdb: fix signal names/numbers
    - libgc: gives "Cannot set SIG_THR_RESTART handler" error since SIG_THR_RESTART has been SIGXCPU which is now used for threads
    - (maybe) gcc-4.9 which links against libgc...? (affects objc related code only)
    - dietlibc (patch sent upstream) - https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=769105 TODO: make patch for dietlibc to use LONG_LONG_PAIR for ftruncate64() and then rebuild util-vserver package

- **Kernel 4.19 (ENOTSUP)**

  - `Dropped ENOTSUP (252) constant from kernel with v4.19 <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=93cb8e20d56be40c541475f77b5f565fbb385a4b>`__. Gave problems and parisc is only platform which defined it because of HP-UX, see libuv bug: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=900237. Nevertheless rebuild of libattr, libseliux and fakeroot necessary.

- **Kernel 5.10: Define O_NONBLOCK to become 000200000 (instead of 000200004):**

  - `parisc: Define O_NONBLOCK to become 000200000 <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=75ae04206a4d0e4f541c1d692b7febd1c0fdb814>`__
  - `parisc: Add wrapper syscalls to fix O_NONBLOCK flag usage <http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=44a4c9e443674e6cd3368d3e642dfe9c429d5525>`__
  - `GLIBC PATCH: Remove obsolete defines for HPUX support from fcntl.h and update O_NONBLOCK. <https://sourceware.org/git?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=a24f414ba11a7acdf3c5ccec3fb327fc72166556>`__
  - `dietlibc Debian bug report <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=974690>`__

- **Kernel 6.1 (MADV_WIPEONFORK, MADV_KEEPONFORK, ...)**

  - This patch `parisc: Align parisc MADV_XXX constants with all other architectures <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=71bdea6f798b425bc0003780b13e3fdecb16a010>`__ changed some MADV values to have the same number as other platforms (exception: alpha arch). Even if that's an ABI change, the patch includes a wrapper to translate the values, so that old binaries will continue to work. There were build issues in aws-crt-python, qemu-user, tor browser and boringssl.

- **glibc 2.35 and Kernel < 6.10 (compat recv/recvfrom, sys_fanotify_mark)**

  - Arnd Bergmann noticed that various compat syscalls changed how they were implemented in glibc and kernel. His path series `linux system call fixes <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240620162316.3674955-1-arnd@kernel.org/>`__ fixes this and suggests that people should use Debian bookworm with glibc >= 2.35 and Linux kernels >= 6.10.

- **glibc 2.41 and executable stack in dlopen'ed share libaries**

  - With glibc 2.41, any package with a shared library that may be dlopen'd must be rebuilt with gcc-14 or later.
    Otherwise you may get error messages like: "cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument".
