The PA-RISC/Linux Project
=========================

What is it?
-----------

PA-RISC is the proprietary HP RISC processor architecture originally
designed for HP-UX. Project to run Linux on these machines started in
October 1998. Linux first booted on PA-RISC on 25 June 1999. The PA-RISC
Linux Kernel is now integrated into 2.6 mainline (`parisc git tree
<http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/deller/parisc-linux.git>`__).
Two linux distributions now support PA-RISC: Debian (since woody 3.0,
released) and Gentoo (experimental). PA-RISC linux is not officially
supported by HP.
