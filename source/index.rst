- The PA-RISC project provides a *native* port of Linux to the PA-RISC
  architecture.

- Linux on PA-RISC is stable and runs on most PA-RISC machines and in
  a virtual :doc:`Qemu <qemu>` machine.

- Check the :doc:`PARISC FAQ <parisc_faq>` and :doc:`Hardware support
  <hardware_support>` if you have trouble installing Linux.

  controller: https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2025

Mar 2025
~~~~~~~~
- With glibc 2.41, any package with a shared library that may be dlopen'd must be rebuilt with gcc-14 or later.
  Otherwise you may get error messages like: "cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument".

Feb 2025
~~~~~~~~
- Dave fixed another long-standing glibc floating-point bug: `Miscompilation of sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64/s_fma.c

  vfork syscall instead of emulating it via the clone() syscall
  <https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2024-December/162834.html>`__.
  There is quite some difference like when which process continues. This showed up
  in the testcases of the strace package.

Oct 2024
~~~~~~~~
- The PA-RISC Wiki has been replaced by a ReadTheDocs static website and
  is now hosted at https://parisc.docs.kernel.org. The website source code
  is available at https://github.com/hdeller/parisc-website
- `Dave Anglin <mailto:dave.anglin@bell.net>`__ works on
  `switching gcc to use LRA <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=113933>`__
- `Dmitry Sibirtsev <mailto:sibirtsevdl@gmail.com>`__ added support for

  disassembly/disassembler framework
  <https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/commit/9daa1ffbac35f553c4b2c0428af0b5cfdd6850d7#diff-c579e1e2290a10e71b47294265bc0be7b553b8c9fea1d3bd5b9b9546417ff5f5R2>`__.
  Capstone is used by by QEMU and other projects.

Sep 2024
~~~~~~~~
- Qemu v9.1.0 released. Needs at least `one patch for system-mode
  <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/ead5078cf1a5f11d16e3e8462154c859620bcc7e>`__
  and `one patch for user-mode
  <https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/d33d3adb573794903380e03e767e06470514cefe>`__
  to run stable with 64-bit CPUs.

- Some patches for Linux kernel to fix 64-bit userspace issues.

Jul 2024
~~~~~~~~
- The `Debian 64-bit time_t transition
  <https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/64bit-time>`__ has finished and
  stability of PA-Linux has improved greatly. Important next milestones
  will be to port rust to hppa, and maybe to add a LLVM backend for
  parisc.

Jun 2024
~~~~~~~~
- `Dave Anglin contributed a patch
  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=72d95924ee35c8cd16ef52f912483ee938a34d49>`__
  which prevents the random segfaults we faced on PA8800 and PA8900 CPU
  machines. It is included in kernel 6.6.35, 6.9.6, and 6.10.0 (and
  higher).
- Work has started to add clock_gettime() syscalls in kernel vDSO.

Apr 2024
~~~~~~~~
- The `Debian 64-bit time_t transition
  <https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/64bit-time>`__ is going very
  well. Upgrades were broken until now, but since end of april 2024 it's
  possible again to upgrade most existing debian hppa installations to
  the new binaries from the debian-ports archive. Since now 64-bit
  time_t is enabled by default, and since the LFS64 filesystem calls are
  enabled by default as well, we expect much lesss problems running
  debian hppa.
- `Qemu 9.0 was released. <https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/9.0>`__ Note
  that the 64-bit hppa emulation is still incomplete and may work with
  Linux guests only.

Mar 2024
~~~~~~~~

- Improving 64-bit CPU emulation in Qemu, e.g. with `CPU fixes from
  Richard <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-03/msg06872.html>`__
  and `HP-UX 11 64-bit support fixes from Sven
  <https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2024-03/msg06020.html>`__.
- The `Offline_Diagnostic_Environment\_(ODE)
  <Offline_Diagnostic_Environment_(ODE)>`__ CD-ROM is helpful to verify
  quality of Qemu CPU emulation.
- `Debian 64-bit time transition is ongoing
  <https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/64bit-time>`__. Lots of hppa
  packages have to be bootstrapped again.

Jan 2024
~~~~~~~~
- `Initial rust libc support for hppa
  <https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/3539>`__ was added (and
  temporarily removed again).

Nov 2023
~~~~~~~~
- Upcoming Qemu v8.2 will support booting a 64-bit Linux kernel.

Sep 2023
~~~~~~~~
- `Kernel 6.6

  supports Block-TLBs (BTLB) on 32-bit kernels.
- Kernel 6.6 includes `native eBPF JIT compiler for 32- and 64-bit
  kernels <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=48d25d382643a9d8867f8eb13af231268ab10db5>`__.

  ip 0xf5f7e307`` syslog warnings <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30750>`__
- Development to support 64-bit PA-RISC CPU emulation and Astro/Elroy
  PCI-Bridge emulated device in QEMU started. Goal is to (hopefully)
  allow booting a 64-bit Linux kernel and HP/UX 11 with 64-bit support
  in QEMU.
