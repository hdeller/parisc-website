    Now, if PA-RISC was a major architecture, we'd have to figure this
    out. But as it is, PA-RISC is just about the shittiest RISC ever
    invented (with original sparc being a strong contender), and let's
    face it, nobody really uses it. It's a "fun project", but it is not
    something that we should use to mess up either ACCESS_ONCE() or the
    MCS locks.
